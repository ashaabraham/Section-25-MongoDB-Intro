Section 25 MongoDB (NoSQL db)
	alternate way of stopping/starting services:
		net stop MongoDB
		net start MongoDB
	list existing dbs
		show dbs
	create/switch to db called ratingportal
		use ratingportal
	insert data into restaurants collection (collection will be created if it doesn't exist)
		db.restaurants.insertOne({ name: "Munich Schnitzelhouse", address: {street: "Some Street 5", streetNumber: "23b" } })
	read data - to get all documents in collection
		db.restaurants.find()
	read data - to get specific documents in collection
		db.restaurants.find( {name: "Munich Schnitzelhouse"} )
	read data - to get all documents in field but only include name field and exclude id field in collection (id is automatically included except if explicitly excluded, others are automatically excluded if you explicitly include at least one field).  First paramater is filter condition, second paramater is which fields to show in result
		db.restaurants.find({}, {name: 1, _id:0} )
	read data - to get one document  (findMany for multiple)
		db.restaurants.findOne( {name: "Munich Schnitzelhouse"} )
	update data (updates street of object with given id) updateMany for multiple
		db.restaurants.updateOne({_id:ObjectId('658bb9d9d0dd0d12af331fe7')}, { $set: {"address.street": "Some Street"}})
	delete data
		db.restaurants.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId('658bba53d0dd0d12af331fe8')})
	delete all data
		db.restaurants.deleteMany({})
	find reviews with rating > 4
		db.reviews.find({rating: {$gt: 4}})
	find reviews with rating > 1 && < 3
		db.reviews.find({$and: [{rating: {$gt: 1}}, {rating: {$lt: 3}}] })
